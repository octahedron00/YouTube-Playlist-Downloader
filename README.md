# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader

YouTube Playlist Downloader for Me.

Helped by using pytube and ffmpeg.

You can download your YouTube Playlist.

## How to run

Copy/Download the code, and change a bit if you need.

**You must first install/download ffmpeg, if you want mp3, not webm.**

- Download ffmpeg from [https://ffmpeg.org/]
- Move the folder to somewhere else.
- Change "Enviorenment Variable" settings in Windows.

(webm can be used as mp3, by changing the name only, however.)

**If you have YouTube Premium account, you can use it by using oauth in the code.**

- Premium account is known for its unique accessibility to 256 kbps audio, but I can't find the way.
- So, the quality won't change, as I know.

Activate the code, and everything will work well.
